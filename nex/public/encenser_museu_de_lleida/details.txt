Encenser

Time: Century VI AD
  
Encenser from the Bovalar Basilica (Seros). It is cylindrical body and with smooth walls, framed by two edges that are projected at the base and mouth. They support it three feet riveted to the base in the form of trifolium that end up in the form of feline legs and claws. The cover has hemispheric shape and is remanded with a flower crowned by a pineapple and a dove. The hemispheric area shows three circles with the anagram of Christ inscribed, where the incense came from.
