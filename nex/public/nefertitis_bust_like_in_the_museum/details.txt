Nefertitis Bust

This replica of the bust of Nefertiti was created in the 1930s and is made of plaster and paint. This bust of Nefertiti is a very rare replica – one of only three – made off of the original, which is currently in the Egyptian Museum Berlin. Nefertiti, as you can see, lived up to her name which means, “The Beautiful One Has Arrived.” Her left eye is missing. This doesn’t mean that she was blind in one eye and it doesn’t mean that this was lost. This was only a sculptor’s model, never meant to be a work of art on its own. The sculptors would take this model out to the site and use it to show what Nefertiti looked like rather than have Nefertiti sit there.

Date: 1930s
